# Quiskit

⚛︎ Quiskit is an open-source software development kit (SDK) used to write quantum programs and run them on quantum computers.

## 1. How does Quiskit work?

Quiskit is an open-source software development kit (SDK) for working with quantum computers. It allows users to create and run quantum programs on a variety of quantum devices, as well as simulate quantum circuits on classical computers.

Quiskit is built using Python and includes a variety of tools for creating and manipulating quantum circuits, as well as tools for optimizing and compiling quantum programs. It also includes support for running programs on a variety of backends, including IBM's cloud-based quantum computers.

The basic workflow for using Quiskit involves creating a quantum circuit using Quiskit's tools, compiling the circuit to run on a specific backend, and then executing the compiled program on the backend. Users can then retrieve the results of the program, which may include measurements of the quantum state of the system.

Overall, Quiskit provides a powerful and flexible platform for working with quantum computers, and is a valuable tool for researchers and developers in the field of quantum computing.
